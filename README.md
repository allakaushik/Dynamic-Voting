#  Electronic Voting System

This project implements an electronic voting system to ensure secure and tamper-proof voting. The system encrypts votes to maintain confidentiality and automatically detects any tampered votes, guaranteeing the integrity of the voting process.

How It Works

1. Voter Registration: Voters are registered with unique voter IDs.
2.Vote Casting: Registered voters can cast their votes securely. The votes are encrypted before being stored to prevent tampering.
3.Audit and Integrity Check: The system decrypts the votes and counts them. Any tampered votes are detected and flagged.
